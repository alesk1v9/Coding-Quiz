# Coding Quiz

A coding quiz is a web application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to test users' knowledge of coding concepts. The HTML defines the structure of the quiz,  CSS styles the quiz, providing a visually appealing layout.
JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the quiz. It manages the timer, tracks user responses, and calculates the final score. Questions are presented one at a time, and users select answers through clickable options. Incorrect answers may result in time penalties.
Upon completing the quiz, the user sees their final score and is prompted to enter their initials. This information can be stored locally.
Additionally, there may be features like viewing high scores, clearing scores, or returning to the home page.
